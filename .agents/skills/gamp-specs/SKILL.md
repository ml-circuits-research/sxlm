name: gamp-specs
description: Rebuild or initialize a software project with a `README.md` that introduces the project and documents verified setup and usage, repository guidance in `AGENTS.md`, HTML documentation under `docs/`, and consecutively numbered design specifications under `docs/specs/`. Use when Codex must create, normalize, or synchronize these documents with the implementation and the repository's current skill catalog.

# GAMP Specs

## Overview

Normalize or initialize a project into a consistent repository structure. Store human onboarding in `README.md`, agent instructions in `AGENTS.md`, explanatory HTML pages under `docs/`, and design specifications (DS files) under `docs/specs/`. A DS file records requirements, constraints, rationale, confirmed limitations, and contract boundaries as declarative statements. Always ingest existing guidance first and reshape it into the standard structure without discarding verified project information. This skill absorbs and supersedes the previous `gamp-structure` behavior, so the scripts, references, assets, and structural guarantees from that skill must remain available here.

Read `references/documentation-writing-guidelines.md` before writing any persistent documentation. Use `references/docs-structure.md` for layout, README content, and file placement; `references/technical-docs-guidelines.md` for HTML pages; `references/diagrams-guidelines.md` for diagrams; and `references/specs-guidelines.md` for DS files. Apply HTML-specific rules only to HTML pages.

Run `detect-main-behaviors` after repository discovery and before defining or updating the DS set. Treat its accepted-behavior handoff as the required evidence boundary for the Main Behavior DS.

## Final-Product Documentation Policy

The generated documentation must describe the product as it is intended to exist when delivered to its users: its stable purpose, supported interfaces, responsibilities, workflows, constraints, and operational behavior. Documentation is a product contract, not a progress report.

- Do not describe the target repository as an intermediate development step.
- Do not include phrases such as “currently contains,” “not implemented yet,” “planned interface,” “future implementation,” “design only,” or equivalent status commentary in `README.md`, HTML pages, or ordinary explanatory prose.
- Do not weaken final behavior into progress language merely because the source repository is incomplete while the product design is being developed. Describe the required or delivered product behavior directly.
- Record confirmed behavior, missing contract details, and implementation boundaries in the affected DS file as declarative statements; do not surface repository-progress commentary in user-facing documentation.
- When a capability is part of the product contract but its concrete command, setting, or provider mapping is not specified, document the stable behavior and state that boundary declaratively without narrating the development phase.
- Review every generated document for temporal qualifiers about repository state and remove them unless the qualifier is part of the product's user-visible lifecycle or versioning contract.
- Treat documentation-generation and documentation-review skills as internal authoring tools. Their use is implementation detail of the documentation workflow, not part of the product contract.
- Never mention the documentation skills used to create, rebuild, normalize, or review the project documentation in `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, HTML pages, DS files, the specification matrix, comments, captions, footers, provenance notes, or generated content. Do not state that documentation was generated, reviewed, validated, or remediated by `gamp-specs`, `review-specs`, or any equivalent documentation skill.
- Do not create pages, sections, DS files, glossary entries, badges, credits, navigation links, or dependency lists for those internal documentation skills merely because they were available or used during authoring.
- Mention a skill only when the target repository implements, distributes, or exposes that skill as part of the product itself. This product-scope exception does not permit authoring-process commentary about using the skill to produce the documentation.

## Workflow

### 1. Discover Source Material

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and any existing `docs/` content.
- Read the source code in the same manner you normally do when asked to analyze a project: scan the tree, inspect entry points, follow key dependencies, and review the current skill folders.
- Verify every substantive technical claim against the implementation before documenting it.
- Extract required narrative, constraints, and terminology from those sources.
- Remove existing authoring-process references to documentation-generation or documentation-review skills unless the referenced skill is itself an implemented product subject. Preserve product behavior while removing tool provenance.
- Identify the project's intended users and the verified installation, configuration, startup, integration, and usage paths that apply to its project type.
- Keep all written output in English, including `README.md`, HTML documentation, specs, and `AGENTS.md`.
- Run `detect-main-behaviors` against the discovered source, documentation, tests, public interfaces, architecture, and relevant development evidence. Preserve its accepted and rejected candidate boundary for specification generation.

### 2. Apply the Standard Structure

- Use `references/docs-structure.md` as the required layout and naming rules.
- Use `references/documentation-writing-guidelines.md` for reader assumptions, wiki definition links, concrete language, concept order, and comparison rules across every document.
- Use `references/technical-docs-guidelines.md` when writing or revising the HTML pages.
- Use `references/specs-guidelines.md` when writing or revising the DS specifications.
- Define the DS spec set based on project scope.
- Always begin with `DS000-vision.md` and `DS001-coding-style.md`.
- Create `DS002` for the next foundational project contract required by the repository, consolidating related material when necessary so the file has a substantive scope.
- Always create exactly one Main Behavior specification named `DS003-main-behavior.md` with the frontmatter title `DS003-main-behavior`. Reserve this filename identifier for Main Behavior and place it after the preceding foundational specifications.
- Build the Main Behavior DS only from candidates accepted by `detect-main-behaviors`. Include the project purpose, user-impacting business behaviors, major hidden behaviors that materially affect essential functionality, project-special behaviors, principal paths, broad project-spanning behaviors, essential APIs or commands, active consequences of direction-changing decisions, and architectural skeleton identified by that analysis.
- Structure `DS003-main-behavior.md` specially while retaining `Introduction` and `Core Content` as its only top-level content sections. Inside `Core Content`, create one `###` chapter for every accepted Main Behavior component, using the ordered component names from the detector handoff.
- When `DS003-main-behavior.md` contains two or more Main Behavior components, begin `Core Content` with a `### Main Behavior Components` summary table containing exactly two columns: `Name` and `Explanation`. Add one row per component and no auxiliary columns. Omit the table when there is only one component.
- In every component chapter, state the affected user or consuming actor, the business or functional outcome, the initiating trigger, the principal behavior and observable result, any hidden mechanism with a major functional consequence, any distinctive project-specific behavior, and the governing boundary or invariant. Keep evidence details concise and link to specialized DS files for lower-level contracts.
- Write DS003 with concrete product names and direct verbs. Name important commands, routes, environment variables, paths, lifecycle actions, profiles, and other interface surfaces when users, operators, agents, or integrations rely on them. Do not replace these facts with abstract architecture language or remove them merely because their names are technical.
- Explain each component in terms a product user, operator, or integrator can understand without reading source code. Keep private helper calls and incidental implementation mechanics out unless they produce a major functional consequence.
- Keep feature catalogs, helpers, optional integrations, narrow configuration, and implementation detail out of the Main Behavior DS. Link to specialized DS files when a main behavior needs deeper contracts without duplicating them.
- When a project uses WebSkel, read the `webskel-ui-engineering` guidance, require that skill in `AGENTS.md`, and carry its coding rules into `DS001-coding-style.md`. Give every WebSkel-specific term a detailed, verified entry on `docs/wiki.html` and link its eligible occurrences to that entry.
- In a skill-catalog repository, create one DS file for each skill that the repository implements or distributes as part of its product, plus any additional DS files needed for shared architectural topics such as model strategy. Exclude documentation skills that were merely used as internal authoring tools.
- In a downstream project that only consumes imported skills, keep the DS set focused on the host project itself. Do not create DS files under `docs/specs/` whose subject is the imported skills.
- Keep the DS sequence contiguous with no missing intermediate numbers. The foundational sequence is `DS000`, `DS001`, `DS002`, then `DS003-main-behavior.md`; subsequent files continue from `DS004`.
- Ensure the DS files are reachable from `matrix.md`, and link each DS entry through the relative path `specsLoader.html?spec=DS0xx-description.md`. Do not begin this path with `/`; repository-scoped GitHub Pages sites must preserve their repository path prefix.
- Treat `DS001-coding-style.md` as the canonical source for coding-style rules and make `AGENTS.md` point to it explicitly.
- Keep the HTML documentation workflow and the DS specification workflow distinct.
- Treat the DS specifications as the source of truth for documented behavior and structure.
- Make every ordinary DS file use only `Introduction` and `Core Content` as its standard top-level content sections. Do not create a `Conclusion` section; when normalizing an existing DS, preserve any substantive conclusion content as declarative material inside `Core Content` and remove the redundant heading.
- Give every `DSxxx-*.md` file exactly two frontmatter fields: `title` and `summary`. Set `title` to the exact filename stem, including its DS number and name, such as `DS003-main-behavior`. Derive the identifier from the filename; never add a separate `id` field.
- Remove `id`, `status`, and `owner` fields and every other unsupported field from existing DS frontmatter. Also remove `Status` and `Owner` headings, sections, labels, metadata blocks, badges, and standalone values from DS content. Do not generate replacements for them elsewhere.
- Normalize all existing DS material into declarative requirements, rationale, constraints, invariants, limitations, or explicitly unspecified boundaries inside `Core Content`.
- Keep every prose block in each DS file unwrapped in the Markdown source: do not insert hard line breaks at an arbitrary column inside paragraphs, list items, captions, or other text blocks. Let the specs viewer wrap text naturally only when it reaches the boundary of its full-width containing box.
- Ensure the rendered DS content uses the full available width of its own box. Do not narrow the specification text container with a fixed or centered `max-width`, oversized padding, fixed label widths, or another artificial width constraint.
- When code changes alter behavior, interfaces, architecture, workflows, or constraints, update both the HTML documentation and the DS specifications to match the implementation.
- Record architectural interpretations, high-risk assumptions, conflict resolutions, and implementation alternatives directly inside the affected DS files as declarative contract statements.
- Keep repository example code inside the relevant skill folders rather than introducing a shared root `src/` tree that copied skills would not carry with them.

### 3. Rebuild HTML Documentation

- Update or create the required HTML pages and shared assets.
- Follow `references/diagrams-guidelines.md` for diagram selection, title captions, actor grouping and consolidation, default vertical layout, centering, visual categories, Mermaid markup, and static asset placement.
- Put each diagram's single centered, italic title caption below the diagram. Make it a concise noun phrase naming what the diagram represents, never an explanation or added commentary. Do not place a separate diagram title above it, and do not frame the whole diagram in a border, background box, card, panel, or shadow.
- Create exactly one canonical terminology page at `docs/wiki.html`. Remove page-local `Definitions` sections and consolidate their supported content into this wiki instead of duplicating definitions across pages.
- Give every project-specific term, acronym, named component, and architectural concept a stable anchor and a detailed, evidence-backed explanation on the wiki. Explain what the term means, why it exists, who or what uses it, how it behaves or participates in workflows, its important relationships, and its boundaries or limitations; do not use a short one-sentence gloss when the repository supports more detail.
- Link every eligible occurrence of a defined term in documentation prose and DS content to its exact `wiki.html#definition-...` anchor. Retain useful inline context when it helps the immediate narrative, but never treat inline text as a substitute for the canonical wiki entry. Keep page titles and section headings unlinked.
- Put `Wiki` inside a required header submenu on every HTML documentation page. Do not expose it as a direct top-level header link.
- Keep every prose block unwrapped in the HTML source and do not force early text wrapping with manual line breaks, narrow fixed widths, or newline-preserving styles. Let text use the full width of its box and wrap naturally only at the box boundary.
- Make the main documentation panel use the full available page width. Do not constrain it with a centered `max-width`; use compact page and panel padding equivalent to `1rem` on desktop, reduced further on narrow screens.
- Keep the narrative consistent with the project’s role and interfaces, especially any agent or system responsibilities described in `AGENTS.md`.
- Review the actual contents of each skill folder and document the local artifacts, dependencies, conventions, and responsibilities instead of relying on shallow summaries.
- Follow `references/technical-docs-guidelines.md`.
- In a skill-catalog repository, provide one HTML page per skill that the repository implements or distributes as part of the product. Do not create pages for documentation skills merely because they were used as internal authoring tools.
- In a downstream project that only consumes imported skills, keep `/docs` focused on the host project. Do not create standalone skill pages there for the imported skills; keep any skill-local notes inside the local skill folders.
- Use one primary navigation system in the header. Every top-level header control must be a submenu button, and every documentation destination must appear inside one of those submenus. Do not place direct navigation links beside the submenu buttons and do not add a second parallel primary navigation system.
- Group all destinations into clearly named submenus according to their subject. A submenu may contain one destination when that subject has only one valid page; do not invent placeholder destinations merely to increase its size.
- Put `Specifications` inside a required header submenu and link its submenu entry to `specsLoader.html?spec=matrix.md`. Put `Wiki` inside a required header submenu and link its submenu entry to `wiki.html`.
- Make every open submenu close when the user clicks or taps outside its menu. Keep the submenu structure and interaction behavior uniform across all HTML pages.
- Treat the project as a standalone system in the HTML documentation. Do not expose machine-specific absolute paths, home directories, usernames, or other workstation-local filesystem details unless the repository itself requires them as part of the documented contract.
- Ensure the HTML documentation reflects the current source code and remains aligned with the DS specifications.
- Provide an index page that explains how the system fits together, where the coding style is defined, how tests are organized, and that `wiki.html` is the canonical source for project terminology. Add one page per skill only when the repository itself is the skill catalog.
- Put a required `Documentation Map` section on `docs/index.html` after the project overview and before detailed technical content unless the target project has an explicitly documented small-scope exception. When present, render it as one responsive, column-oriented semantic table that mirrors the primary header navigation exactly.
- Create one `<th scope="col">` for every top-level header submenu button. Use the exact button text and preserve the header's left-to-right order. These headings describe navigation groups and are not links.
- Under each heading, list every destination from that header submenu in the same order. Each non-empty `<td>` must contain one real `<a>` link using the same label and target as the submenu entry, followed immediately by a short, specific description of what that page represents. Align submenu positions by row and leave surplus cells empty and non-interactive when menu lengths differ.
- Include every header submenu destination exactly once and include no destination that is absent from the header. A specification submenu entry may point to the matrix or loader, but individual DS or specification files must not be expanded into the map unless they are explicit header submenu destinations.
- Preserve normal link behavior, meaningful text, and visible keyboard focus. Do not use non-navigating `<button>` elements, JavaScript-only navigation, a decorative card grid, or descriptions that merely repeat the page title.
- Keep the semantic table visually open rather than drawing a rigid spreadsheet grid. Use whitespace, alignment, restrained group headings, and light entry surfaces; empty cells must remain visually empty.
- Follow the table with concise reading-flow prose that uses the real header group and page names to tell a new reader where to start and how to proceed. Do not add generic metadata columns such as `Order`, `Page`, `Purpose`, or `Subpages`.
- Treat the Documentation Map as an onboarding shortcut surface inside the home-page content, not as a second primary navigation system. It must remain consistent with the header submenus, breadcrumbs, parent-to-child links, and specification entry point.

### 4. Create or Update `README.md`

- Create `./README.md` if it does not exist; otherwise update it without discarding verified project guidance.
- Begin with a short introduction that identifies the project, the user problem it addresses, and its main role. Follow with a high-level overview that does not require knowledge of the source code.
- Document every applicable onboarding path supported by the project: prerequisites, installation, configuration, application startup, library or service integration, and basic usage.
- Include only the onboarding sections that apply to the project. For example, document integration instead of startup for a library that has no standalone process.
- Verify commands, filenames, environment variables, configuration values, and examples against the implementation. Do not infer a setting's purpose, accepted format, or effect from its name, and do not invent a missing setup path.
- When the repository confirms that a setup value is required but does not explain how to obtain or format it, document only the confirmed requirement. State declaratively in the affected DS what the repository confirms and which acquisition or format detail remains unspecified. Do not propose alternative implementations unless the project establishes a genuine unresolved design choice.
- After code changes, recheck `README.md` whenever installation, configuration, startup, integration, public interfaces, or usage may have changed.

### 5. Create or Update `AGENTS.md`

- Create `./AGENTS.md` if it does not exist; otherwise update it.
- Do not create `./AGENT.md` or any other compatibility duplicate.
- Write the paths to the HTML documentation entry points, `docs/wiki.html`, and the specifications directory in `AGENTS.md`.
- Use a clear section template in this order: `Scope`, `Mandatory Reading Order`, `Current Skill Catalog`, `Repository Rules`, `Runtime Defaults`, and `Key Paths`.
- Instruct future agents to read `DS001-coding-style.md` for coding style, module structure, and test-organization rules.
- Instruct future agents to read the HTML documentation, the canonical terminology wiki, and the relevant per-skill DS files before making documentation-related changes.
- State explicitly that the DS specifications are the source of truth.
- State explicitly that when source code changes, the HTML documentation and the specifications must both be updated to reflect the change.
- State explicitly that all documentation, specifications, and comments must be written in English.
- State explicitly that `AGENTS.md` must mention the skills implemented or distributed by the repository as product artifacts and must be updated when that product skill catalog changes. Exclude documentation skills used only as internal authoring tools.
- State explicitly that downstream consumer projects must not put imported-skill DS files or skill pages inside the host project's `docs/` tree.
- State explicitly that DS numbering must remain gap-free.
- Instruct future agents to run `detect-main-behaviors` before creating the Main Behavior DS and whenever source or product changes may alter the project's purpose, user or business outcomes, essential paths, public interfaces, broad subsystems, major hidden functional consequences, special project behavior, architectural skeleton, or active direction.
- State explicitly that DS rationale, limitations, assumptions, and contract boundaries use declarative prose in `Core Content` and do not depend on a separate repository decision log.
- Require future documentation changes to follow `references/documentation-writing-guidelines.md` or the equivalent copied project guidance.

### 6. Install the Specs Loader

- Copy `assets/specsLoader.html` to `docs/specsLoader.html` every time docs are rebuilt.
- Copy `assets/.nojekyll` to `docs/.nojekyll` every time docs are rebuilt. This marker disables GitHub Pages Jekyll processing so the specs loader can fetch the published `.md` files without GitHub Pages converting them to `.html`.
- Do not edit this file in-place; update the asset if changes are needed.

### 7. Run Post-Generation Verification

- After generating or updating the HTML documentation and DS specifications, run verification checks before finishing.
- Verify that the generated HTML files reference the specifications through valid links.
- Verify in particular that users can reach the specs set from the HTML documentation through working links to `docs/specsLoader.html`, `docs/specs/matrix.md`, or equivalent spec entry points actually used by the project.
- Verify that HTML references to individual specs or the specs matrix resolve to existing files.
- Verify that `matrix.md` links each DS file through the relative path `specsLoader.html?spec=DS0xx-description.md` without a leading slash.
- Verify that the specification matrix has exactly two columns: `Name`, containing the linked `DS0xx-description` filename stem, and `Description`, containing a short explanation. Do not generate `Title`, `Status`, `Owner`, or other columns.
- Verify that the generated spec files exist at the paths referenced by the HTML documentation.
- Verify that `docs/wiki.html` exists, every wiki link resolves to an existing stable anchor, and no ordinary documentation page retains a local `Definitions` section.
- Verify that `docs/.nojekyll` exists so repository-scoped GitHub Pages deployments publish specification Markdown files unchanged.
- Verify that DS numbering is contiguous by checking the current spec directory contents rather than trusting a template.
- Verify that exactly one `DS003-main-behavior.md` exists, that the matrix reaches it, and that every behavior it contains appears in the accepted handoff from `detect-main-behaviors`.
- Verify that `DS003-main-behavior.md` has one `###` component chapter per accepted behavior in detector order. When it has multiple components, verify that `Core Content` begins with a summary table containing exactly `Name` and `Explanation`, with one row per component; when it has one component, verify that the table is absent.
- Regenerate `docs/specs/matrix.md` from the DS files instead of editing it manually.
- Run the documentation link verifier after documentation work so shared navigation, specs-loader links, and partial includes stay valid.
- When the HTML documentation uses relative asset paths, `fetch()`-loaded partials, or other browser-resolved resources, run `node scripts/verify_static_site.js <docs-dir>` against the generated `docs/` folder. Add `--path` checks for project-specific resources when needed.
- Verify that each affected DS file states important rationale, tradeoffs, limitations, and contract boundaries declaratively in `Core Content`.
- Verify that documentation and DS prose are not hard-wrapped in source files, that no presentation rule forces an early wrap, and that both HTML and rendered DS text use the full available width of their own containing boxes.
- Verify that every `DSxxx-*.md` frontmatter contains exactly `title` and `summary`, that `title` equals the filename stem, and that no separate `id`, `status`, `owner`, or other field exists. Also verify that no `Status` or `Owner` section, label, badge, or equivalent standalone metadata remains.
- Unless an explicit small-scope exception applies, verify that `docs/index.html` contains the required Documentation Map table; its column headings exactly match the top-level header submenu buttons in text and order; and each column contains exactly that submenu's links in order. Verify that every non-empty body cell contains one matching link plus a concise page description, every header destination appears exactly once, no extra destination or individual unlisted specification appears, every target resolves, surplus cells are empty, and the reading-flow prose agrees with the navigation.
- Verify each applicable README onboarding procedure against the current source, manifest, configuration, and executable entry points.
- Verify that README, HTML pages, and DS files describe the final product contract and contain no repository-progress commentary. Express implementation alternatives and unspecified contract details as bounded declarative statements in the affected DS file.
- Verify that no persistent project documentation reveals which documentation-generation or documentation-review skills were used. Treat any such mention as prohibited internal-tool leakage and remove it.

### 8. Quality Checks

- Validate that links between `index.html`, other HTML pages, and specs loader work.
- Validate that the HTML pages expose valid navigation paths to the specs set.
- Confirm the HTML documentation uses one primary header navigation system in which every top-level control is a submenu button and every destination appears inside a submenu. Reject all direct top-level header links.
- Confirm `Specifications` and `Wiki` are submenu entries that resolve respectively to `specsLoader.html?spec=matrix.md` and `wiki.html` on every HTML page.
- Confirm an open submenu closes when the user clicks or taps outside it, each submenu groups destinations by a clear subject, no submenu is empty, and a one-item submenu exists only when its subject has one valid destination.
- Confirm the home-page Documentation Map is a responsive table rather than a card grid, its headings and entries mirror the primary header menus exactly, and every page link has a useful short description directly below it. Confirm that there are no generic metadata columns, unlisted destinations, expanded specification files, or rigid cell borders; that surplus cells are visually empty; and that the reading flow supplements rather than contradicts the header navigation.
- Confirm the HTML documentation does not mention workstation-specific absolute filesystem paths or other local-machine details that are not part of the project's real interface.
- Validate that any HTML link pointing to specs, the specs matrix, or the specs loader resolves to an existing target.
- Confirm referenced static assets are stored under `docs/assets/` rather than embedded into the HTML files.
- Confirm the main documentation panel spans the available page width, has no fixed or centered maximum width, and uses compact responsive outer and inner padding.
- Confirm every diagram complies with `references/diagrams-guidelines.md`.
- Confirm every diagram is centered and uses a vertical layout by default; straightforward unidirectional step chains are consolidated into meaningful composite boxes, with useful detail moved into prose below. Confirm every caption is a centered title below the diagram that only names what the diagram represents, the diagram has no enclosing visual frame, and documentation and DS text is not manually wrapped before reaching its container boundary.
- Ensure every ordinary spec file follows the `DS0xx-description.md` convention, includes only the standard `Introduction` and `Core Content` content structure, has no `Conclusion` section, and fits into the required numbering sequence.
- Confirm every DS file uses only `title: DSxxx-name` and `summary` frontmatter and omits separate `ID`, `Status`, and `Owner` metadata completely, including frontmatter, headings, metadata panels, badges, and body labels.
- Confirm the Main Behavior DS covers supported user-impacting business behaviors, major hidden functional behaviors, and project-special behaviors; contains only defining project behaviors; stays aligned with the detector's evidence; and refers readers to specialized DS files for lower-level detail.
- Confirm each Main Behavior component has its own chapter and explains user or business impact, functional outcome, trigger, observable result, major hidden consequence where applicable, distinctive project behavior where applicable, and its boundary or invariant. Confirm every DS003 table has no more than two columns and that the required multi-component summary table uses only `Name` and `Explanation`.
- Confirm DS003 names concrete actors and interfaces, uses direct verbs and plain explanations, retains important interface surfaces, and contains no abstract substitute for behavior that can be stated directly.
- Confirm the specs matrix links correctly via `specsLoader.html?spec=matrix.md`.
- Confirm each DS entry in `matrix.md` uses the relative specs-loader path format `specsLoader.html?spec=DS0xx-description.md` without a leading slash, so links work under both domain-root and repository-prefixed deployments.
- Confirm `docs/.nojekyll` matches `assets/.nojekyll`; without this deployment marker, GitHub Pages may convert specification Markdown files to `.html` and break the specs loader's `.md` fetch requests.
- Confirm `AGENTS.md` points to the correct HTML documentation paths, the correct specs path, and `DS001-coding-style.md`.
- Confirm `AGENTS.md`, `docs/index.html`, and `docs/specs/matrix.md` mention the implemented or distributed product skill set consistently and exclude authoring-only documentation skills.
- Confirm the HTML documentation and specs are synchronized with the implementation, with specs kept authoritative if wording diverges.
- Confirm downstream-consumer documentation rules are explicit: imported skills stay documented inside `skills/`, not in the host project's `/docs` DS set.
- Confirm rationale, alternatives, limitations, and contract boundaries are written as declarative statements in `Core Content` and that no DS depends on a separate decision-log file.
- Read `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the HTML pages, the canonical `docs/wiki.html`, and the DS files in their intended order. Confirm ordinary pages contain no local `Definitions` section, every project-specific term has one detailed wiki entry with a stable anchor, and every eligible occurrence links to that exact canonical anchor. Confirm page titles and section headings contain no definition links.
- Confirm every wiki entry uses complete explanatory prose and covers the term's meaning, purpose, users or owners, behavior or workflow role, important relationships, and confirmed boundaries or limitations instead of stopping at a short gloss.
- Confirm feature documentation states the role and practical use before internal behavior, configuration, or architecture.
- Replace unexplained abstract nouns, literary phrases, and decorative comparisons with concrete statements about verified actors, actions, data, or results.
- Confirm `README.md` contains an introduction, a high-level overview, and every applicable installation, configuration, startup, integration, and basic-usage procedure.
- Confirm no user-facing documentation treats the product as a temporary step, reports that code is absent or unfinished, or labels its interfaces as merely planned. The documentation must read as the final product contract even while development continues.
- Confirm `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, HTML pages, DS files, the specification matrix, comments, captions, footers, and navigation contain no mention of internal documentation skills or their use, except where a skill is itself an implemented and distributed subject of the product. Even under that exception, do not describe the documentation as generated or reviewed by that skill.
